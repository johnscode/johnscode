### Hello

Experienced development leader with decades of experience having successfully built and lead several successful startup teams. 
Have architected, built, and delivered scalable, reliable systems for IoT, Enterprise Software, Mobile, and SaaS.  
Co-inventor on several patents. MS in Computer Engineering and a BS Electrical Engineering.

I post thoughts on dev topics at [dev.to](https://dev.to/johnscode)

## Recently playing around with AI and SaaS 

Check out these repos:
- [AI Chat Assistant using Claude 3](https://github.com/johnscode/claudius-saas) - A basic chat assistant built using Next.js and React
- [A boilerplate SaaS using OpenAI and Replicate](https://github.com/johnscode/next14-ai-saas) - this is pretty well-featured with integrations to Clerk, Crisp, and Stripe. Built  using Next.js and React
- [Python Notebook demonstrating news classification](https://github.com/johnscode/py-news-classification)
- Python Notebook for Titanic Challenge

## Golang coding exercises
I have a running series of blog posts related to data structures and algorithms in Golang that you can find [here](https://dev.to/johnscode/series/27729). Here is the repository for all the code in those posts.
- [Go coding challenge code](https://github.com/johnscode/gocodingchallenges)

## Some Useful Boilerplate Code I Developed
- [Microservice using Golang and gofr using postgres with seed db and migration pattern](https://github.com/johnscode/go-gofr-template) *this has a lot of promise*
- [Microservice using Golang and chi](https://github.com/johnscode/go-chi-microservice-template) *lots of runtime on this one*
- [Microservice using Python, FastAPI, and Mongo](https://github.com/johnscode/py-fastapi-mongo) *very nice when you have to use python for the microservice*
- [Node.js and Mongo REST service](https://github.com/johnscode/node-mongo-template) *used some version of this too many times to count*
- [Node.js and PostgreSql REST service](https://github.com/johnscode/node-postgres-template) 
- [Webapp template using Golang and Fiber](https://github.com/johnscode/go-fiber-template)
- [REST Microservice template using Golang and Echo](https://github.com/johnscode/go-echo-template)
- [Webservice template using Python, Django, and MongoDB](https://github.com/johnscode/py-django-mongo)
- [Webservice template using Python, Flask, and MongoDB](https://github.com/johnscode/py-flask-mongo)

## Some React Applications I have written
- [AI Chat Assistant using Claude 3](https://github.com/johnscode/claudius-saas) - A basic chat assistant built using Next.js and React
- [A boilerplate SaaS using OpenAI and Replicate](https://github.com/johnscode/next14-ai-saas) - this is pretty well-featured with integrations to Clerk, Crisp, and Stripe. Built  using Next.js and React
- [A Simple Calculator App](https://github.com/johnscode/react-calculator) - The source code from this [blog post](https://dev.to/johnscode/creating-a-calculator-app-using-reactnext-4j4n) on dev.to
